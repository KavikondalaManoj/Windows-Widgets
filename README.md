# Disk-Utility-
DriveWidget is a frameless, always-on-top PyQt6 utility that monitors local and network drives via psutil. It shows free/total space with progress bars, lets you add/remove/custom-name drives, persists settings to JSON, auto-refreshes every 5s, is draggable and minimizes to a floating toggle button.
